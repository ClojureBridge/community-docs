The *set* is a data structures. Most computer languages have this data structure.
It looks like an array (or a vector, in Clojure terms), but every element is unique.
Elements are stored in no particular order.

We can create *set* data structures by using the `set` function. We can also create it with var binding.

The syntax is: `(set coll)`

{% highlight clojure %}
user=> (set '[111 1 2035 1 57 111])
#{1 111 2035 57}

user=> (def my-set #{"Jan", "Feb" "Mar" "Apr" "May" "Jun"})
#'user/my-set
user=> my-set
#{"Jun" "Apr" "Feb" "May" "Jan" "Mar"}
{% endhighlight %}

Let's try more examples. We will use sentences from "Pride and Prejudice," Chapter 59.
Copy and paste this into your repl.
