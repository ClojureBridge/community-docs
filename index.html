  <h1>Get into Clojure with ClojureBridge</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Welcome to <a href="http://www.clojurebridge.org">ClojureBridge</a>
    CommunityDocs, the central location for material supporting and extending the core ClojureBridge 
		curriculum <a href="https://github.com/ClojureBridge/curriculum">(https://github.com/ClojureBridge/curriculum</a>).
		Our goal is to provide additional labs and explanations from coaches to address the needs of attendees from a wide
		range of cultural and technical backgrounds. 
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    In most cases ClojureBridge attendees will work through lab problems with the help of coaches,
		so "notes for the instructor" should be included in each document to promote a consistent
		experience across all classes. 
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    <b>Help Wanted!!</b><br/>
    Yes, we really want help from <b>you</b>. It's going to take a village to raise a new generation of Clojure
		developers. We've had a fantastic response from the Unsession at Clojure/Conj and the ClojureBridge
    mailing list from people asking how to contribute. By reviewing, improving, and adding new documents here, 
		we can and will grow the Clojure community!
    <br/>
		<br/>
    Please <b>fork the repo, improve or add document(s), and send us a pull request.</b>
    Your work will become an appreciated and enduring piece of future ClojureBridge workshops.
